For this to import the necessary modules you must make sure you have the
modules4all repo source added into your very own repo. If you've already used
the repository creator at http://totalrevolution.tv/create_repo.php then it will already be setup, if not
then use it to create a repo and copy the modules4all section into your own repo addon.xml.

<h3>ONCE ADD-ON IS INSTALLED:</h3>
Go through the default.py and read the comments for each section.
Enable each section in the Main_Menu() function one by one and start to see your add-on come to life!

<h3>ONCE ADD-ON IS INSTALLED:</h3>

This is a very simple template to follow, all you need to do is add/edit the
YouTube ID's (lines 62-66) - these can be either playlist or channel ID's.

In the Main_Menu() function all you need to edit is the relevant Add_Dir command,
if using a playlist then the url must start with BASE and if it's a channel you need
to use BASE2. In these Add_Dir commands you can edit the title which shows as well as
the artwork.

Have a little play around, it's very fun and easy to do and you'll have
your very own YouTube based add-on up in no time and every time you update your YT
channel/playlist the changes will automatically show in your add-on!!!
